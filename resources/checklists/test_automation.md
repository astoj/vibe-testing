  - [ ] Define environments as code
  - [ ] Use the same environment definitions in CI and local development
  - [ ] Include all dependencies in environment definitions

- [ ] **Mock or sandbox external services:** Avoid network dependencies by using mocks or stubs
  - [ ] Create reliable service mocks
  - [ ] Test both with mocks and real services
  - [ ] Simulate different responses including errors

- [ ] **Apply version control for test environments:** Track environment configurations to maintain reproducibility
  - [ ] Version environment definitions alongside code
  - [ ] Document environment setup and configuration
  - [ ] Automate environment provisioning and teardown

## üìã 7. Test Data & Fixtures

- [ ] **Use representative datasets:** Ensure test data reflects real-world conditions and edge cases
  - [ ] Create datasets that cover various scenarios
  - [ ] Include both valid and invalid data
  - [ ] Test with minimum and maximum values

- [ ] **Automate data setup and teardown:** Simplify test maintenance by programmatically creating and removing test data
  - [ ] Reset state between tests
  - [ ] Create test-specific databases or schemas
  - [ ] Use transactions to isolate database changes
